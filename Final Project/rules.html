            <h2>Base Rules</h2>
            <p>
                Mahjong is a 4-player game of skill, strategy, and calculation — involving a degree of chance.
                The goal is to be the first player to complete a legal hand using drawn and discarded tiles.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each player starts with 13 tiles.</li>
                <li>Players take turns drawing and discarding tiles.</li>
                <li>The winning hand consists of 4 melds and a pair (unless using special hands).</li>
                <li>Points are awarded based on hand value and winning method (drawn or discard).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Chinese Mahjong</h2>
            <p>
                Chinese Mahjong has many variations, but typically emphasizes higher-point hands
                and often uses a points-based payout system.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Common hands include Pungs (three of a kind) and Chows (sequences).</li>
                <li>Flowers and Seasons tiles provide bonus points.</li>
                <li>Winning may require a minimum point threshold (such as 8 points).</li>
                <li>Scoring is based on patterns, bonus tiles, and method of winning.</li>
                <li>Self-draw wins often score extra points.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Riichi Mahjong</h2>
            <p>
                Riichi Mahjong (Japanese style) is characterized by its emphasis on declared ready hands
                ("Riichi") and structured scoring using Yaku (hand patterns).
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Declaring "Riichi" locks your hand and allows bonus points.</li>
                <li>Winning hands must have at least one Yaku (valid hand type).</li>
                <li>Special moves include "Ippatsu" (winning within one round after Riichi) and "Dora" bonuses.</li>
                <li>Penalty points exist for invalid hands ("Chombo").</li>
                <li>Scoring is strictly calculated with Han and Fu values.</li>
            </ul>
