      <h2>General Mahjong Tips</h2>
      <p>Whether you're just starting or looking to improve your game, here are some general tips to enhance your Mahjong strategy:</p>

      <div class="rule-section">
        <h3>1. Know Your Tiles</h3>
        <p>Understanding the different types of tiles (bamboo, characters, dots, winds, dragons) and their meanings is essential. The better you know your tiles, the better your chances of making strategic decisions during gameplay.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-section">
        <h3>2. Don't Overextend</h3>
        <p>It’s tempting to go for high-scoring hands, but sometimes it’s better to play conservatively. If you’re unsure about your hand, focus on completing a basic hand first before chasing a more complex one.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-section">
        <h3>3. Watch Your Opponents</h3>
        <p>Pay attention to what your opponents are discarding and which hands they seem to be building. This can give you insight into their strategy and help you avoid discarding tiles they need.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-section">
        <h3>4. Consider the Joker</h3>
        <p>If you're playing a variant that uses jokers, use them wisely. Don’t waste jokers on low-scoring combinations; save them for the harder-to-complete hands that will give you higher points.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Variant-Specific Tips</h2>
      <p>Different Mahjong variants come with their own unique twists. Here are some tips for popular variants:</p>

      <div class="rule-section">
        <h3>Riichi Mahjong</h3>
        <p>Riichi is a popular variant that requires a lot of strategy and patience. Here are some tips:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Riichi Declaration:</strong> Don’t declare Riichi unless you’re confident that you’re only one tile away from completing your hand. This can give away your strategy to other players.</li>
          <li><strong>Keep an Eye on the Dora:</strong> The Dora indicator can greatly increase your hand’s value. Keep track of the dora tiles and adjust your strategy to make use of them.</li>
          <li><strong>Discard Wisely:</strong> Don’t discard your honors (winds and dragons) too early. These tiles can be useful for completing a hand or forming a concealed hand.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="rule-section">
        <h3>Chinese Mahjong</h3>
        <p>Chinese Mahjong often involves a different set of rules and scoring. Here are a few tips:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Focus on Pungs:</strong> In Chinese Mahjong, Pungs (three-of-a-kind) are valued higher than other combinations, so try to aim for them in your hand.</li>
          <li><strong>Be Patient with Chows:</strong> Chows (three consecutive tiles of the same suit) can be valuable, but they often take longer to form. Be patient and focus on your other sets while waiting for the right tiles.</li>
          <li><strong>Balance Your Hand:</strong> In Chinese Mahjong, balance is key. Avoid going too heavily for one type of combination (like only Pungs or Chows) and try to keep your options open.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>Example 1: All Simples</h3>

      </div>

      <div class="rule-section">
        <h3>Example 2: Half Flush</h3>
        <p>A hand consisting entirely of one suit (bamboo, dots, or characters), Wind or Dragon Tiles and a pair. This hand is challenging to complete but yields high points.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="rule-section">
        <h3>Example 3: Seven Pairs</h3>
        <p>A hand made up of seven pairs. This hand has a unique value and is a popular target for many experienced players.</p>
        <img src="7Pair.jpg" class="winning-hand-image">
      </div>

      <div class="rule-section">
        <h3>Example 4: Thirteen Orphans</h3>
        <p>The Thirteen Orphans hand consists of one of each of the terminal tiles (1 and 9 of each suit) plus a pair of one of the terminal tiles. This is one of the most iconic hands in Mahjong and is incredibly difficult to achieve.</p>
