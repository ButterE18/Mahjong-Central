Description: Mahjong Central is a website intended to shed light to the game of Mahjong for users to delve into. This website includes helpful guides and tools to get started in understanding the game through personal experience. It includes terminology, rules, tips, and a score tracker with helpful links to external sites for further information. Whilst it does not include gameplay, my targeted audience include those who are unfamiliar with the game's mechanics and pieces that may deter them from looking further into.
